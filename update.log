==========================================================================

Yipu Miao	05/21/2010  1.1.0.0  : new quick can now read pdb file as input. But hasn't reach the calculation part.
Yipu Miao	05/24/2010  1.2.0.0  : Add keyword "atombasisâ€œ and "residuebasis" to specify fragment method.
				       if it's residue based, pdb file is needed, while atom based, no pdb file is needed
Yipu Miao	07/14/2010  1.3.0.0  : Add HF SCF calculation. Divcon is partly work, but under test.
Yipu Miao	07/23/2010  1.4.0.0  : First final version. Divcon works. Some tests are done. But still buggy,
				       especially the convergence problem.
Yipu Miao	07/27/2010  1.5.0.0  : Add elimination step, improve accuracy. kill some bugs.
Yipu Miao	10/25/2010  1.5.0.0  : Add MPI option for div&con diag.
Yipu Miao	11/03/2010  1.5.0.0  : Add MPI option for HF calculation. Not available for UHF and DFT
				       Optimze output format.
Yipu Miao	11/04/2010  1.5.0.0  : Complete MPI for HF and Divcon, valid for 1e,2e and diag(div-con only) part.
Yipu Miao  	11/10/2010  1.5.0.0  : Complete MPI for MP2, only valid for HF MP2, not valid for Divcon MP2. Optimize code
Yipu Miao  	11/22/2010  1.5.0.0  : Add optimization option. And MPI is valid for gradient calculation.
Yipu Miao  	11/22/2010  1.5.0.0  : Add freq and hessian matrix calculation. But is broken from last author. not support MPI
Yipu Miao  	12/13/2010  1.5.0.0  : Fix MP2 problem
Yipu Miao  	01/05/2011  1.5.0.0  : milestone version.
Yipu Miao  	02/18/2011  1.5.0.0  : rewrite method module and try to make quick as an Open-Object project. reorganize file system.
				       now all source will be stored in src folder.
Yipu Miao  	02/23/2011  1.5.0.0  : opt makefile, add subs folder.
Yipu Miao  	06/09/2011  1.5.0.0  : fix some bugs.
Yipu Miao	xx/xx/2015  2.0.0.0  : Milestone version uploaded to github for public use. 
Madu Manathunga 01/21/2019  2.1.0.0  : Fixed cuda code for working on pascal and volta type gpus.
Madu Manathunga 03/12/2019  2.1.0.1  : Added tests folder, test cases and testqk.sh
Madu Manathunga 03/15/2019  2.1.0.2  : Integrated dft gradient computation capability.
Madu Manathunga 04/15/2019  2.1.1.0  : Fixed several bugs in HF MPI versions.
Madu Manathunga 04/24/2019  2.1.1.1  : Updated Makefiles and make.in files.
Madu Manathunga 04/28/2019  2.1.1.2  : Implemented DFT enerrgy and gradient MPI versions.
Madu Manathunga 06/14/2019  2.1.1.3  : Integrated Libxc library, CPU & MPI versions can compute energy and gradients using all LDA, GGA
				       and hybrid GGA funtionals.   
Madu Manathunga 08/07/2019  2.1.1.4  : Implemented GPU version of the Libxc library and tested. Approximately, 150 functionals
				       (LDA, GGA and hybrid GGA) are working properly.   
Madu Manathunga 08/10/2019  2.1.1.5  : Reorganized HF and DFT operators into a single scf operator. Cleaned up the code. 
Madu Manathunga 08/13/2019  2.1.1.6  : Reorganized HF and DFT gradient subroutines into a single gradient subroutine. 
				       Cleaned up the code. Enabled gradient only calculations.
Madu Manathunga 09/07/2019  2.1.1.7  : Implemented GPU version of XC gradient code. Debugged the implementation. 
                                       Fixed a bug related to legacy BLYP and B3LYP calls in scf & gradient codes in CPU version.
