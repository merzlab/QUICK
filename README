1. INSTALLATION 

Go to quick main folder and create 3 folders named "bin", "lib" and "obj".

1.1 SINGLE CPU INSTALLATION 
You can use gnu or intel compilers for this purpose. Go to quick main folder and run following commands. 
If you are using gnu compiler (version 4.6 or later)

	cp ./makein/make.in.gnu ./make.in
	
If you are using intel compiler (version 2011 or later)

	cp ./makein/make.in.intel ./make.in

Then run the following command. 

        make quick
     
This will compile a single CPU version of quick. 

1.2 MPI INSTALLATION
If you have intel mpi installed (version 2011 or later), you can compile the MPI version by running following commands 
from quick main folder. 

	cp ./makein/make.in.MPI ./make.in
	
	make quick.MPI

1.3 CUDA VERSION INSTALLATION
If you want to install the GPU version, NVIDIA CUDA COMPILER is required. You may check your CUDA compiler version using 
'nvcc --version'. 
a) Run the following command.

	cp ./makein/make.in.gnu.cuda ./make.in

b) Open up the make.in file and set CUDA_HOME. This is essential to link or compile CUBLAS and other libraries.

	CUDA_HOME=(your cuda home) 

c) You may have to change the "-gencode arch=compute_70,code=sm_70" options in nvcc compiler 
flags depending on the type of your GPU. The default value (70) is for a Volta gpu. Use 30, 50, 60 and 75 for Kepler,
Maxwell, Pascal and Turing GPUs respectively. 

	-gencode arch=compute_(your gpu),code=sm_(your gpu)
	
d) If you want to support f orbital, set CUDA_SPDF=y in make.in file. 
This will take a longer time and memory to compile. Otherwise, leave the default value CUDA_SPDF=n for s, p and d orbital. 	
	
	CUDA_SPDF=(y or n)  

e) Then run
     
     make quick.cuda

in ./bin directory, you can find executable files. 


2. USAGE
We suggust you to put the following into your PATH. Edit ~/.bashrc, then add this line

        export PATH=(YOUR QUICK DIR)/bin:$PATH

and add basis set path
	
	export QUICK_BASIS=(YOUR QUICK DIR)/basis

where (YOUR QUICK DIR) is your directory.

The basic principal of QUICK is that the simpler, the better. So in the input file, the first line is calculation
card. For example
    HF ncyc=3 energy BASIS=6-31gs denserms=1.0e-7
This means HF calculation is required and after 3 cycles, we calculate the difference of Fock matrix. The basis set is 
6-31g** and the convergence criteria is 1.0E-7. If you don't know anything about quantum chemistry, this card is 
recommended.

After the first line, you should mention your molecule geometry in the following format. 

C           4.5916       2.6127       4.3145
H           6.8049       4.5138      -2.5775
H           8.3134       7.7325      -1.0688
H           4.3547       2.9911       3.3201
H           4.5176       3.5187       3.7129

Each line specifies the element and x,y,z coordinates respectively.  

If you save this example as mol.in and run

      quick mol.in

or GPU version
      
      quick.cuda mol.in

you should get mol.out output file. You can find more examples in the benchmarks folder. 

2. SPECIAL NOTE ON THE GPU VERSION 
Currently, QUICK supports CUDA version 4.6 and later. We have tested it on GTX580, M2090, K20, K40, K80, P100, 
V100 and T4. We cannot gureentee that our program is flawless and it is still in the experimental stage.
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us.
