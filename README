1. INSTALLATION 

1.1 SINGLE CPU INSTALLATION 
You can use gnu or intel compilers for this purpose. Go to QUICK main folder and run the following
commands.  If you are using gnu compiler (version 4.6 or later)

	cp ./makein/make.in.gnu ./make.in
	
If you are using intel compiler (version 2011 or later)

	cp ./makein/make.in.intel ./make.in

Then, run the following command. 

        make quick
     
This will compile a single CPU version of quick. 

1.2 MPI INSTALLATION
If you have intel mpi (version 2011 or later) installed, you can compile the MPI version by running 
following commands from quick main folder. 

	cp ./makein/make.in.MPI ./make.in
	
	make quick.MPI

1.3 CUDA VERSION INSTALLATION
If you want to install the GPU version, NVIDIA CUDA COMPILER is required. You may check your CUDA 
compiler version using 'nvcc --version'. 
a) Run the following command.

	cp ./makein/make.in.gnu.cuda ./make.in

b) Open up the make.in file and set CUDA_HOME. This is essential to link or compile CUBLAS and other 
	libraries.

	CUDA_HOME=(your cuda home) 

c) You may have to change the "-gencode arch=compute_70,code=sm_70" options in CUDA_FLAGS 
variable depending on the type of your GPU. The default value (70) is for a Volta gpu. Use 30, 50, 60 
and 75 for Kepler, Maxwell, Pascal and Turing GPUs respectively. 

	-gencode arch=compute_(your gpu),code=sm_(your gpu)

d) Then run
     
     make quick.cuda

in ./bin directory, you can find executable files. 


2. TEST

Run testqk.sh script from the quick main folder. Depending on your installation, you might want to 
change the qexe variable value in line 12. The default ("quick.cuda") is for the gpu version. To test 
single cpu and MPI installations, change it to "quick" and "quick.MPI" respectively.   


3. USAGE

We suggust you to put the following into your PATH. Edit ~/.bashrc, then add this line

        export PATH=(YOUR QUICK DIR)/bin:$PATH

and add basis set path
	
	export QUICK_BASIS=(YOUR QUICK DIR)/basis

where (YOUR QUICK DIR) is your QUICK installation directory.

The basic principal of QUICK is that the simpler the better. So in the input file, the first line is 
calculation card. For example
    HF ncyc=3 energy BASIS=6-31gs denserms=1.0e-7
This means HF calculation is required and after 3 cycles, we calculate the difference of Fock matrix. 
The basis set is 6-31g** and the convergence criteria is 1.0E-7. If you don't know anything about 
quantum chemistry, this card is recommended.

After the first line, you should specify the information related to molecular geometry in the following 
format. 

C           4.5916       2.6127       4.3145
H           6.8049       4.5138      -2.5775
H           8.3134       7.7325      -1.0688
H           4.3547       2.9911       3.3201
H           4.5176       3.5187       3.7129

Each line specifies the element and x,y,z coordinates respectively.  

If you save this example as mol.in and run

      quick mol.in

or GPU version
      
      quick.cuda mol.in

you should get mol.out output file. You can find more examples in the benchmarks folder. 


4. CLEANING UP

To completely clean up a quick installation, run the following command from quick main directory.

	make clean


5. SPECIAL NOTE ON THE GPU VERSION 

Currently, QUICK supports CUDA version 4.6 and later. We have tested QUICK on GTX580, M2090, K20, K40, 
K80, P100, V100 and Titan V. Our program is still in the experimental stage and we cannot guarantee that 
it is flawless. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us.
