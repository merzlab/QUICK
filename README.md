An open source, GPU enabled, *ab initio* and density functional
theory program developed by Götz lab at University of California San Diego and Merz
lab at Michigan State University.

Features
--------
* Hartree-Fock energy calculations 
* Density functional theory calculations (LDA, GGA and Hybrid-GGA functionals available).
* Gradient and geometry optimization calculations 
* Mulliken charge analysis
* Supports QM/MM calculations with Amber21
* MPI parallelization for CPU platforms
* Massively parallel GPU implementation via CUDA for Nvidia GPUs
* Multi-GPU support via MPI + CUDA, also across multiple compute nodes

Limitations
-----------
* Supports only closed shell systems
* Supports energy/gradient calculations with basis functions up to d  
* Supports only cartesian basis functions (no spherical harmonics)
* DFT calculations are performed exclusively using SG1 grid system 

Installation
